This is my about me page.
  
🌟 **Assalam-o-Alaikum!** 🇵🇰

I'm Azeem, a passionate developer from the heart of Pakistan!  
💻 Coding is my chai, and creativity is my biryani masala.  
When I'm not debugging, you'll find me enjoying a hot cup of doodh patti ☕ or exploring the vibrant streets of Lahore.

**What I Love:**  
- 🚀 Building cool web apps  
- 🎨 Designing with a desi twist  
- 📚 Learning new tech (and desi memes!)  
- 🍲 Foodie adventures (Nihari, anyone?)

**Skills:**  
- JavaScript, Python, React  
- UI/UX with a sprinkle of Pakistani colors  
- Problem-solving with a side of humor 😄

Let's connect and add some Pakistani tarka to the tech world!
